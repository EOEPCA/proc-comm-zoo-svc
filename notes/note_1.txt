The dependency system for EOEPCA projects has been changed. We have moved from a model git submodules to
CMAKE ExternalProject (https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.0/module/ExternalProject.html).

This solution allows us to include dependency using CMAKE directives only.
The SystemBuilder will take care of downloading the repository, synchronizing and connecting the remote project to the local.
